# Setup

Chkk Upgrade Intelligence is a cloud-hosted MCP service—you don’t need to install any binaries or run a local agent. All interaction happens through your IDE’s MCP client.

## Prerequisites

• A kubeconfig pointing at the cluster you want to upgrade  
• An IDE / AI tool that supports MCP (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, Windsurf)  
• A Chkk account and API token (grab it from the Chkk dashboard)

## One-Time Configuration

1. Copy your API token from the dashboard.  
2. In your IDE settings add an MCP server entry pointing at `https://api.chkk.dev/mcp` and include the header `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>`.  
3. Restart the IDE so the new server is detected.

That’s it—continue with the guide for your tool of choice:

- [VS Code](/vs-code)
- [Claude Code](/claude-code)
- [Windsurf](/windsurf)
