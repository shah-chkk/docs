# Getting Started

This short tutorial shows how to create a safe Kubernetes upgrade plan using Chkk from inside your IDE. We will use Cursor in the examples, but the same prompts work anywhere MCP is supported.

## Three-Message Flow

1. `@chkk scan production` – Chkk inventories the live cluster and lists any blockers.
2. `@chkk plan kubernetes 1.28 → 1.29` – Chkk returns a numbered playbook plus unified diffs.
3. `@chkk health-checks` – Chkk suggests Prometheus rules and kubectl commands to monitor the rollout.

Save the generated files (they come back as code blocks or attachments) to your repository and open a pull request as usual.

## Output Structure

```
.chkk/
  upgrade-plan.yaml
  diffs/
    cluster.yaml
    addons/
      ingress.yaml
      coredns.yaml
  observability/
    prometheus-rules.yaml
```

That’s all you need to move from idea to audited upgrade.
