# VS Code Integration

## Installation

Download Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it for your operating system. Optionally, install the GitHub Copilot Chat extension from the VS Code Marketplace for AI chat features.

## Configure the Server

Open *Preferences â†’ Settings (JSON)* and add:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "chkk": {
      "endpoint": "https://api.chkk.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <CHKK_API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

Restart VS Code and verify the Chkk MCP server is registered and tools are listed.

## Example Usage

To fetch upgrade diffs for a specific upgrade and project installation, use:

```
@chkk mcp get-diffs --upgrade-id=abc --project=installation --component=cert-manager
```

Chkk will respond with the relevant diffs for cert-manager in the specified upgrade context.

## Usage

- Use the above prompt in Copilot Chat or your preferred AI extension to retrieve upgrade diffs for any component or upgrade ID.
- Replace `upgrade-id` and `component` as needed for your scenario.
