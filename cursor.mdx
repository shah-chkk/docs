# Cursor + Chkk

## Installation

Download Cursor from [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux). Once installed, launch Cursor and proceed to configuration below.

Restart Cursor after saving.

## Settings Snippet

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "chkk": {
        "endpoint": "https://api.chkk.dev/mcp",
        "auth": {
          "type": "Bearer",
          "token": "<CHKK_API_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

Restart Cursor and verify the Chkk MCP server is registered and tools are listed.

## Example Usage

To fetch upgrade diffs for a specific upgrade and project installation, use:

```
@chkk mcp get-diffs --upgrade-id=abc --project=installation --component=cert-manager
```

Chkk will respond with the relevant diffs for cert-manager in the specified upgrade context.

## Usage

- Use the above prompt in Cursor's chat panel to retrieve upgrade diffs for any component or upgrade ID.
- Replace `upgrade-id` and `component` as needed for your scenario.
