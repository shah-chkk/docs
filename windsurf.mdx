# Add the Server

## Installation

Windsurf is a cloud-based collaborative IDE. Access it at [windsurf.dev](https://windsurf.dev/) and sign in with your team account. No local installation is required.

In your Windsurf workspace settings include:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "chkk": {
        "endpoint": "https://api.chkk.dev/mcp",
        "token": "${WIND_SURF_SECRET_CHKK_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

Refresh Windsurf and verify the Chkk MCP server is registered and tools are listed.

# Example Usage

To fetch upgrade diffs for a specific upgrade and project installation, use:

```
@chkk mcp get-diffs --upgrade-id=abc --project=installation --component=cert-manager
```

Chkk will respond with the relevant diffs for cert-manager in the specified upgrade context.

## Usage

- Use the above prompt in Windsurf's chat or command panel to retrieve upgrade diffs for any component or upgrade ID.
- Replace `upgrade-id` and `component` as needed for your scenario.
